                <p>Below is a map covered with clustered data, each cluster displays the number of historical sites
                    present inside the cluster and is drawn proportional to the number of sites. </p>

                <p>The clustering is done entirely by the map. All of the points in the viewable extent are loaded from
                    the data source and the clustering is performed client side. As you pan and zoom, all of the
                  clusters are re-calculated.</p>

                <p>The data is provided by the
                    <a href="http://mhc-macris.net/">Massachusetts Historial Commisssion</a>.</p>

                <h4>Beware</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>If you zoom out sufficiently far, you will have to
                    wait (perhaps quite a while) for the clusters to be
                    calculated.</li>

                  <li>There is a known issue with the OpenLayers
                  ClusterSource, new data is only loaded from the source
                  when map is zoomed but not panned. For now, the
                  library has some hacky code that forces data to be
                  loaded when the map pans. If you need this
                  functionality, it will only work when deployed with
                  Wicket in "development" mode, it will fail in
                  "production". More information can be found
